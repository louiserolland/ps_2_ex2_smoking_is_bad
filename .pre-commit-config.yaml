#This hook clears Jupyter notebook outputs before committing.
#It keeps commits clean by excluding cell output changes that don't reflect code modifications.
#This syntax (one quoted arg) is required because arguments with spaces must be passed as a single item; 
#otherwise pre-commit feeds metadata as a standalone key, which nbstripout ignores as invalid.
